						<h2>Who I Am?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I'm Ghita Belbacha, 17 years old, from Casablanca. I attend Ennour high school. I've always been interested in the field of computer programming, but I didn't have the chance to do it. I love learning new things. I believe that it's always fun to do what you love and know how the world works . It's a key to succed in your life. I also trust in my skills and know that I can do great things if I'm passionate about it. Finding solutions to difficult problems is really challenging and this is what I like to do  .</p>

						<h2>My experience in E-nitiate camp!</h2>
					</header>
					<p style="line-height:1.25em;">E-nitiate camp is the first camp that I attended . It's such a great experience . Not only I met new amazing friends , but also I'm sharing my passion with the other 24 participants. The teachers,organizers and volunteers are doing all their best to help us in everything  The classes are just perfect , they're not boring at all . This camp taught me a lot of things about computer science such as <b>"Linux is not an operating system"</b> . It's always great to learn new things that will help you . The activities are very cool. Even though I'm a little bit tired by the end of the day  but it's okey since I develop my knowledge in that field . Everyone is trying to give us the maximum of information about CS . </p>

						<h2>Hobbies!!</h2>
					</header>
					<p>What I love? Actually reading books is what I'm crazy about. It helps me forget problems and relax after a long day of studies. I'm also fond of Mathematics because it makes me think more and I use it in my real life in some difficult situations. I love doing volunteer work since I can help people who are in need. Seeing them happy is really rewarding.Furthermore, I like meeting new people. I believe that it's helpful to talk to  them to figure out how they think so I can have a bigger vision of the world.</p>
